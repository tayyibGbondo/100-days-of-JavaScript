    <ul>
        <li>
            <h2>How to link JavaScript file</h2>
            <p>To link your js file with your js file you need to add a the name script with opening and closing tags then write start writing your JavaScript, but the advantage here is that the JavaScript created inside the HTML document can not be used in other files so here comes in the absolute linking where you just need to modify the Script tag by adding the SRC attribut equalt to the location of where the JavaScript file is you wanted to use, all JavaScript file should end with .js extension, i aslo learned that JavaSccript can not only be linked and the bottom ofyour html document close to the body tag, you can even link JavaScript from anywhere in you html file but adding an extra attribute name defer, what use defer? the defer attribute in the script prevent slow loading of the page by default when the html page is loaded it first start loading the JavaScript and sometime ended up showing error causing the DOM not to load, so the defer actually tells the browser to ignore the JavaScript and strart with loading the html and other file first. </p>
        </li>
